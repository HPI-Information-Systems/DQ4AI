# Classification README
This directory contains all scripts and results to make the regression experiments reproducable. We use these three datasets:
- [Credit](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data), referenced as `SouthGermanCredit.csv`
- [Contraceptive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/30/contraceptive+method+choice), referenced as `cmc.data`
- [TelcoCustomerChurn.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), referenced as `TelcoCustomerChurn.csv`
- [COVID](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset), referenced as `covid_data_pre_processed.csv`



## Running the experiments
In a console from the dataquality_4ai directory, run:
```bash
python -m classification.classification
```
Note: If you do not want to see the logging messages but decent progress bars, change `start_logging(cmd_out=True)` to `start_logging(cmd_out=False)`.
The log files can be found in `data/logs`.

This runs `classification/classifications.py`, which sets up the execution pipeline for:

- the five classification algorithms, implemented in `classification/experiments.py`
  - if wanted or needed, scaling can be included specifically for each algorithm
- the four classification datasets 
  - `cmc.data`, `SouthGermanCredit.csv`, `TelcoCustomerChurn.csv`, `covid_data_pre_processed.csv`
- the four scenarios 
  - `train_clean_test_polluted`, `train_polluted_test_clean`, `train_clean_test_clean`
- and every polluter with its configurations 
  - `ClassBalancePolluter`, `CompletenessPolluter`, `ConsistentRepresentationPolluter`, `FeatureAccuracyPolluter`, `TargetAccuracyPolluter`, `UniquenessPolluter`.

The polluters' configurations are generated by the respective `configure()` method in its polluter class.

## Generating the plots
In a console from any directory, run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and navigate to `dataquality_4ai/notebooks/PlottingClassificationResults.ipynb`. The notebook is currently designed to load one json file per polluter containing its results, but if you generated only one results file with the aforementioned console call, you need to read in that instead.

The plotting and preprocessing methods can be found in `classification/plotting.py` and `classification/preprocessing.py`
